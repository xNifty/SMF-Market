SMF-Market
======
Basic market place page hooked into SMF using their SSI.

About
------ 
Started as a boredom project, continued as a way to practice PHP and learn the better practices for MySQLi.

Requirements
------
1. Simple Machines Forum Software (this makes use of the SMF SSI)
2. MySQL Database
3. The MySQLnd (MySQL Native Driver (for get_result()))

Todo
------ 
1. Finish all class specific TODOs
2. Add banned groups list (same as moderating groups, but as a banned group)
3. Potentially tie in through panel within SMF for changing groups and things far easier
4. Rewrite to use AJAX for live updating without the need to refresh the page (homepage only, not the search page)
5. Add sources list to thank the creators of some images used

Scratched
------
1. ???

Important
------
Please don't make use of this market yet - full written directions to make this work are ongoing and this is undergoing changes fairly often.
This market does require a manual change to the SMF files to make use of the PM feature and some things will be changing over time.  
I do not actively check this repository, as I have lots of other things going on. While I do constantly update the project, the best place to report bugs
and other issues is on my personal tracking page, located at https://ibenifty.me/bug_tracking
